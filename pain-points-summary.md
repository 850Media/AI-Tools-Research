## Common Themes

### 1. Prompting is Hard
*Tools assume users know how to prompt well.*
- Users get bad results because they don't know what to ask
- No guidance on how to get better outputs
- **FieldMatrix approach:** Pre-built prompting, no user skill required

### 2. Output Quality Varies
*AI makes stuff up, hallucinates, or produces inconsistent results.*
- Users can't trust output without verification
- Especially problematic for professional/business use
- **FieldMatrix approach:** Guardrails, conservative output, factual only

### 3. Generic, Not Specialized
*Most tools are general-purpose, not industry-specific.*
- Don't understand field service terminology
- Don't know industry workflows
- **FieldMatrix approach:** Industry-specific context

### 4. Learning Curve
*Tools require time to learn and master.*
- Busy workers don't have time
- Training costs for businesses
- **FieldMatrix approach:** Zero learning curve, natural interaction
